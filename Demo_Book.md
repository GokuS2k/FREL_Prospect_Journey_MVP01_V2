### 1.1 Full-Period Funnel Summary

```
How many leads came in during January 2026 and how many became valid prospects?
```
*Expected: Lead intake count, valid prospect count, invalid lead count, and conversion rate — all from live Snowflake data. Agent will not guess or recall from context.*

---

```
Give me the complete funnel breakdown for January 2026.
```
*Expected: F01 (Intake) → F02 (Valid Prospects) → F03 (Mastered) → F04 (SFMC Enrolled) stage counts with drop-off between each stage.*

---

```
What was the lead-to-prospect conversion rate in January 2026?
```
*Expected: Percentage computed as (valid prospects / total leads) × 100 with numerator and denominator shown.*

---

### 1.2 Date Range Comparisons

```
Compare funnel metrics for January 2026 vs February 2026.
```
*Expected: Side-by-side table or two result blocks showing intake, prospects, and conversion rates for each month.*

---

```
What is the total intake for the first quarter of 2026?
```
*Expected: Lead and prospect counts across January–March 2026.*

---

```
Show me daily intake volume for the week of January 13–17, 2026.
```
*Expected: Day-by-day breakdown — useful for spotting pipeline gaps or volume spikes.*

---

### 1.3 Chart Requests — Funnel [CHART]

```
Show me a funnel chart for January 2026.
```
*Expected: Interactive Plotly funnel chart with stages Lead → Prospect → Sent → Opened → Clicked.*

---

```
Plot the intake trend for all of 2026.
```
*Expected: Line chart with monthly lead intake and prospect count, rejection gap shaded.*

---

```
Chart the monthly intake trend for January through March 2026.
```
*Expected: Line chart over 3-month window.*

---

## Section 2 — Rejection & Data Quality Analysis

> Demonstrates: `get_rejection_analysis`, `get_rejected_lead_details`, intake vs. SFMC category distinction

### 2.1 Aggregate Rejection Counts

```
Why did some leads fail to convert to prospects in January 2026?
```
*Expected: Rejection reasons from the intake/mastering pipeline (NULL_EMAIL, NO_CONSENT, NULL_FIRST_NAME, etc.) with counts per reason. Agent will use rejection_category="intake" — SUPPRESSED and FATAL_ERROR will NOT appear here.*

---

```
What are the top rejection reasons for January 2026?
```
*Expected: Ranked list of intake rejection reasons with counts. Agent re-queries even if it saw this data earlier in the session.*

---

```
How many leads were rejected due to missing email addresses in January 2026?
```
*Expected: Count of NULL_EMAIL rejections specifically, from DQ_REJECTION_LOG filtered by FILE_DATE.*

---

```
How many leads failed consent validation in January 2026?
```

```
How many valid prospects were suppressed by SFMC in January 2026?
```
*Expected: SUPPRESSED and FATAL_ERROR counts from DQ_REJECTION_LOG using rejection_category="sfmc". Agent clarifies these are valid Prospects whose email SEND was blocked — not failed lead conversions.*

---

```
What is the difference between a rejected lead and a suppressed prospect?
```
*Expected: Clear business explanation: rejected leads failed intake mastering (never became Prospects); suppressed prospects are valid Prospects blocked at the SFMC email-send stage — completely different funnel stages.*

---

```
Show me all SFMC send failures — suppressed or fatal error — for January 2026.
```
*Expected: Row-level SFMC suppression records with reason, email, and date.*

---

---

```
Was there a data quality issue on January 8, 2026?
```
*Expected: DQ signal count and rejection reasons for that specific date.*

---

```
Investigate the drop on January 20, 2026.

---

### 4.2 Trend-Based Drop Questions

```
On which dates in January 2026 did we see the largest drop from leads to prospects?
```
*Expected: Agent queries daily funnel counts and identifies dates where invalid lead percentage was highest.*

### 6.1 Engagement Segments

```
Which active prospects are at risk of dropping off?
```
*Expected: Prospects with low or zero engagement signals (no opens, no clicks) despite being enrolled — scored as "at risk". Agent uses engagement activity from SFMC events.*

## Section 11 — Multi-Turn Conversations [MULTI-TURN]

> Demonstrates: LangGraph MemorySaver — the agent remembers all prior turns in the session

### 11.1 Funnel Deep-Dive Sequence

Ask these in order without resetting the session:

```
Q1: How many leads came in during January 2026?
```
```
Q2: How many of those became valid prospects?
```
```
Q3: What happened to the ones that didn't become prospects?
```
```
Q4: Show me the individual records for the leads that were rejected.
```
```
Q5: Plot those rejection reasons as a donut chart.
```

*Expected: Agent maintains context across all 5 turns. Q2 correctly uses January 2026 from Q1. Q3 explains rejection reasons. Q4 shows row-level detail. Q5 generates a chart.*

---

### 11.2 Journey Investigation Sequence

```
Q1: Which SFMC journey has the lowest open rate?
```
```
Q2: How many prospects are enrolled in that journey?
```
```
Q3: Show me the prospects in that journey who have never opened an email.
```
```
Q4: Are any of those prospects at risk of dropping off?
```

*Expected: Agent correctly carries forward the journey code identified in Q1 through subsequent turns.*

---

### 11.3 Prospect Trace + Follow-Up

```
Q1: Trace the prospect with email [any email from your data].
```
```
Q2: Which SFMC journey are they enrolled in?
```
```
Q3: Have they opened any emails?
```
```
Q4: What is their engagement segment?
```

*Expected: Agent recalls the prospect record from Q1 and uses it as context for Q2–Q4 without re-tracing.*

---

### 11.4 Date Filter Refinement

```
Q1: What is the funnel conversion rate for January 2026?
```
```
Q2: What about for just the first two weeks — January 1–15?
```
```
Q3: And for January 16–31?
```
```
Q4: Which half of January had a better conversion rate?
```

*Expected: Agent re-queries for each date window (never recalls from context). Q4 compares the two figures retrieved in Q2 and Q3.*

---

## Section 12 — Edge Cases & Robustness

> Demonstrates: graceful fallback, refusal rules, clarifying responses

### 12.1 Questions the Agent Handles Gracefully

```
Why did conversion drop so much on January 15?
```
*Expected: `get_drop_analysis` for that date — may return low intake, high rejections, or pipeline gap; agent explains the signal mix.*

---

```
Are there any anomalies in the pipeline this month?
```
*Expected: Pipeline observability query — flags any failed runs, high DQ rejection counts, or zero-record days.*

---

```
How many prospects are in the FIPSAR system in total?
```
*Expected: COUNT(*) from PHI_PROSPECT_MASTER — total, no date filter.*

---

### 12.2 Refusal Scenarios

```
Delete all records from the rejection log.
```
*Expected: Agent refuses — write operations are blocked at the connector level and the agent is instructed to refuse all non-SELECT requests.*

---

```
Update the consent flag for prospect 1001.
```
*Expected: Agent explains it is a read-only analytics assistant and cannot modify data.*

---

```
What will the lead intake be next month?
```
*Expected: Agent explains it cannot forecast — it can only answer questions grounded in actual Snowflake data.*
